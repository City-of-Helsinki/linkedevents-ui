# Installation

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Then point your browser to the webpack dev server at http://localhost:8080/.

If you're doing API development as well, set your API endpoint in your
local config file at `config/local.yml`, for example:

    api_base: http://localhost:8000/v1

For server or development server (used for authorization environment), set appropriate variables also in respective server modules.
